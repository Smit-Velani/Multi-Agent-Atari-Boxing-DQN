# 🥊 Multi-Agent Atari Boxing with Deep Q-Learning

Two AI agents learn to play Atari Boxing against each other using Deep Q-Networks (DQN). No human input — both agents learn purely from experience through reinforcement learning.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a **multi-agent reinforcement learning** system where two independent DQN agents compete in the Atari Boxing environment. Each agent learns to maximize its own reward (landing punches) while minimizing the opponent's score.

## 📊 Results

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Episodes | 200 |
| Agent 2 Wins | 39 (62% of decisive games) |
| Agent 1 Wins | 23 (37% of decisive games) |
| Training Time | ~12 minutes (T4 GPU) |
| Max Reward Seen | +6 / -6 |

## 🧠 How It Works

### Environment
- **Framework**: PettingZoo Atari Boxing v2 (multi-agent)
- **Observation**: 210×160×3 RGB pixel frame per agent
- **Actions**: 18 discrete actions (move, punch, combinations)
- **Reward**: +1 for landing a punch, -1 for receiving one

### DQN Architecture

```
Input: 4 stacked grayscale frames (4 × 84 × 84)
       ↓
Conv2d(4, 32, kernel=8, stride=4)  → ReLU
       ↓
Conv2d(32, 64, kernel=4, stride=2) → ReLU
       ↓
Conv2d(64, 64, kernel=3, stride=1) → ReLU
       ↓
Linear(3136, 512) → ReLU
       ↓
Linear(512, 18)  ← Q-value for each action
```

### Key Techniques
- **Experience Replay** — stores 10,000 past transitions, samples random batches to break correlation
- **Target Network** — separate frozen network updated every 500 steps for stable training
- **Frame Stacking** — stacks 4 consecutive frames so agent perceives motion
- **Epsilon-Greedy** — starts at ε=1.0 (random), decays to ε=0.1 (mostly learned policy)
- **Bellman Equation** — Q(s,a) = r + γ × max(Q(s',a')) with γ=0.99

## 💡 Key Learnings

- Multi-agent RL is significantly harder than single-agent — both agents are non-stationary targets for each other
- Frame stacking is essential for the agent to perceive movement and direction
- Epsilon decay speed critically affects learning — too fast and agents never explore enough
- Target networks are essential for stable training in competitive environments
